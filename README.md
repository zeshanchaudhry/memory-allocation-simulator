# Operating System Memory Allocation Simulator

This project simulates dynamic memory allocation using four classic algorithms:
- First Fit
- Next Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit

## 🔍 What It Does
- Models Stack, Code, and Heap segments
- Generates randomized processes using stochastic modeling
- Tracks internal and external fragmentation
- Detects “Lost Object” memory leaks
- Runs 12,000+ simulation cycles for performance comparisons

## 📊 Key Outputs
- Memory utilization
- Fragmentation levels
- Allocation strategy efficiency comparison

## 🛠️ Tech Used
C++, OOP, dynamic memory, stochastic process modeling
